## Python Loops and File Handling

Python offers robust capabilities for iterating over sequences and managing files.

Loops

#### 1. For Loops

- Iterate over sequences like lists, tuples, strings, or ranges.
- Execute a block of code for each element in the sequence.

#### 2. While Loops

- Execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
- Useful when the number of iterations is not predetermined.

### File Handling

#### 1. Opening Files

- Use the `open()` function to access files in various modes: read ('r'), write ('w'), or append ('a').

#### 2. Reading from Files

- Read file contents using methods like `read()`, `readline()`, or `readlines()`.
- Enables processing and analysis of external data.

#### 3. Writing to Files

- Write data to a file using the `write()` method.
- Store program-generated information for future use or sharing.

#### 4. Closing Files

- Essential to release system resources and ensure proper data handling.
- Always close files after use using the `close()` method.

### Conclusion

- Python's loops and file handling capabilities are integral to programming tasks.
- Efficiently iterate over sequences and interact with external data sources.
- Python's simplicity and readability make it a preferred choice for handling various programming tasks.
